# Carerely

This project is a social media application that target fitness audience. It was interesting and fun experience in working on this project. we used React with Typescript/Javascript for the client side and for the server side we used Node.js with Typescript/Javascript.
It contains all the essential features of today's social media application. but Its main functionality was to give user nutrition statistic by their diet plan.

It contains lots of real-time features. I have integrated real-time feature with Node.js  framework Socket.io
eg: for chatting, notification on like and comments, chat notification etc.
